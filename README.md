This Node.js application automates the process of creating shipping labels on the ELTA web portal using order data from BigCartel. The app reads order information from a CSV file, prompts the user for necessary details and generates labels using Puppeteer for browser automation.
Prerequisites

    Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
    Puppeteer: The app uses Puppeteer for browser automation.
    .env File: You need to create a .env file with sender details.
